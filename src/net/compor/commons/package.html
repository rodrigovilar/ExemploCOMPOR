Compor Commons contains classes common to all of the subprojects from the 
COMPOR project. These classes are used as a tool in order to ensure "information 
hiding", legibility and consistency in the implementations generated on the 
project´s context. The classes of this project, mostly, are adaptations of the 
Java API´s classes to be used in the COMPOR project, aiming to maximize the 
reuse and flexibility and to minimize the code duplication.
